Both intimate and wide ranging, her work is unafraid of big subjects and big feelings, and sometimes comedic. Her third collection, The Last Skin, extends and develops these qualities.">

Astonished by their discovery, they put the parrots in cages and sent them home.">

In 2009, feeling bored of her middle class life with two children and a respectable job in a small English town, she applied for and got a job at the university of Reykyavik. It turned out to be a tumultuous time for Iceland: the day she accepted, the Icelandic economy crashed and her future salary went through the floor.">

The idea is to be constantly uploading books into the website, a new book every day.
Right now its a list of my personal favourites but I’m working on a way to let everyone recommend their own on the site.

I have no money to invest on the site (I use a free hosting service and no domain name). If you  like the website and would like to continue to see it grow, you can help.">
